    <p>Azerbaijan,[a] officially the Republic of Azerbaijan,[b] is a transcontinental country at the boundary of Eastern
        Europe and West Asia.[9] It is a part of the South Caucasus region and is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the
        east, Russia's republic of Dagestan to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the west, and
        Iran to the south. Baku is the capital and largest city.

        The territory of what is now Azerbaijan was first ruled by Caucasian Albania and later various Persian empires.
        Until the 19th century, it remained part of Qajar Iran, but the Russo-Persian wars of 1804â€“1813 and 1826â€“1828
        forced the Qajar Empire to cede its Caucasian territories to the Russian Empire; the treaties of Gulistan in
        1813 and Turkmenchay in 1828 defined the border between Russia and Iran.[10][11] The region north of the Aras
        was part of Iran until it was conquered by Russia in the 19th century,[12][13] where it was administered as part
        of the Caucasus Viceroyalty.</p>
